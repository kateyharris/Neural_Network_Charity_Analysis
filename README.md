# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
This challenge consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report:

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Deliverable 3: Make three attempts at Optimizing the Model
- Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model

## Results
Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
- 
## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
